This is a python implementation of the perlin noise algorithm which was used
for a computer graphics project (spring 2012). The main use for this algorithm
was to generate 2D textures in which we could use in a 3D world. To generate a
sample texture run perlin_generator.py. You will need the Python Imaging Library
(PIL) installed in order to to run the script. Feel free to play around with the
persistance values and colors to generate different textures. Also, check out
some sample outputs in 2d_noise/ and 1d_noise/.
